Changelog for Panels Everywhere

Panels Everywhere 1.0 (2010-Feb-01)

Panels Everywhere 1.0-beta1
  o Initial commit to CVS
  o #674222: README.txt missed "engine = phptemplate" line for the blank.info -- this is needed so the blank theme can have templates.
  o Make sure that page manager edit screens are NOT run through layouts in case of catastrophic configuration of the site_template.
  o #679206: Using the setting to hide Drupal blocks/regions would cause theme('page') to loop infinitely resulting in either bad HTML or whitescreens.
  o Add some descriptive info text to the content types we offer to help introduce people to what will be IN the content and how they can theme them.
  o Update the README to include instructions on setting the page title to set from the page content pane.
  o Breadcrumb did not display properly in pane navigation due to error in theme.inc
  o #679252: Create a sample variant and include it with Panels Everywhere, with an easy setting to make it go away after it is no longer needed.
